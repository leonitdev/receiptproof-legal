Restore Purchases Policy
ReceiptProof

ReceiptProof supports restoring purchases made through official app stores.

How Restore Purchases Works

Restoring purchases reactivates previously purchased subscriptions or features

No additional payment is required

When to Use Restore Purchases

You change devices

Your subscription appears inactive after login

Limitations

Purchases cannot be transferred between accounts

Restores are only available for purchases made on the same platform (iOS or Android)

Refunds are handled exclusively by Apple or Google

Troubleshooting

If restore does not work:

Ensure you are logged into the correct App Store account

Check your active subscriptions in the App Store / Play Store

Restart the App and try again
